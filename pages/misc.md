- Tree growth analogy
	- Ecosystem growth of high performance network like Solana vs something like Minicash
		- Solana is like a tall tree
		- Minicash is like a wide bush
	- Solana can reach great heights, you can implement most kinds of things
	- Minicash has a limited height, you need to invent higher layers to do most things
	- Both start out with growth like n^3
		- A tall tree fills its footprint and then grows up, it is more linear
		- A wide bush grows outward with limited height, it is more quadratic
	- A tall tree has a core that is hard and homogenous, there is one trunk
	- A sprawling bush is a heterogeneous mass, it might have many distinct root systems
	- Which is more likely to be destroyed or simply collapse under its own weight?
