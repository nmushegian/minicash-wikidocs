- One of the primary principles of the minicash community is that we do not waste time on concern trolls regarding the consensus protocol (the fixed-period, no-difficulty POW variant).
- Instead, we maintain this list of explanations that help people understand why it should work.
- Most importantly, whether or not it works cannot impact the minicash specification, which is finalized. If this consensus protocol doesn't work, that means minicash is defined as a broken system, not that minicash will be "fixed".

	- there might be issues with congestion, but it does not change which chain wins
	- honest miners will not mine on an 'illegitimate' chain. miners mine on definitely-valid, not possibly-valid.
	- in bitcoin, there is nothing special about whether there are 2, 3, or even 4 active head candidates. in any case, the miners just mine on the heaviest one
	- POW would still work even if it was just a stream of [prev, root] with no timestamp, difficulty, or any other parameter, as long as the incentive to mine on the "correct" chain
