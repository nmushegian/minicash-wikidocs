- A thin node is a node that downloads all tocks but only some ticks.
- A thin node is assumed to have a primary "user", this is some person or system.
- A thin node accepts ticks that are confirmed in a header into the database even if it does not establish context for those ticks (no vinx check). This means it could accept a bad tock even if it has the most work.
- The `possibly-invalid` state of knowledge is one that is not used in the core protocol, but is included for completeness. It corresponds to the idea of a fraud proof in progress. In minicash, this would take the form of a user-provided 'suspected bad tockhash'. The thin client would attempt to download the minimum information necessary to confirm that it indeed a `definitely-invalid` tock. It might also be `definitely-valid`. Minicash has no smart incentive scheme for ensuring fraud "proof" alerts are delivered and accurate. It does not need to - you either depend on the POW consensus and know your cost of attack, or run a full node.
