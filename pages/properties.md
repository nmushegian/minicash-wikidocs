- The following hard-coded constants and functions define minicash at a high level. With these, different developers could come up with close to identical systems. The purpose of the specification is to flesh out all the details down to the exact byte layout.
	- There are at most `7` inputs and at most `7` outputs per [[tick]].
	- There are at most `2^17 == 131072` ticks per [[tock]].
	- The time between tocks is exactly `57` seconds.
	- `roll` is defined as `rlp.encode`
	- `hash` is defined as `keccak256`.
	- `scry` is defined as `secp256k1.ecrecover` (compressed pubkey)
- These constants imply that once the software matures, minicash should be able to handle a peak of `2300` tps with absolute worst case of 1.5mbps sustained bandwidth needed to stay synchronized as a full node (and likely only some fraction of this most of the time).
- The total supply is `2^53`. Note that this is one larger than the safe f64 range (max 2^53 - 1). This is intentional -- it is to remind the implementor that at tock-level validation, you *must* use bignums, because a tock can have total outputs greater than the total supply.
	- There is a max-per-output and max-fee rule that says no output or fee may be larger than `2^50 - 1`. This guarantees that wallets can safely use f64 for working with transactions, since each tick has at most 7 outputs (and the fee).
