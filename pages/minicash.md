- Welcome to the minicash wiki
-
- Minicash is a proof of concept of many different ideas
	- The most important concept is the power of a finalized [[specification]]
	- UTXO systems scale much better than most people realize
	- Embeddable thin clients enable a new kind of cross-chain interop
	- The endgame relationship between a [[full node]], [[pool node]], and [[thin node]] is probably different from what most people expect
	- There is a long tail of "web 2.5" business activity, putting logic that cannot be entirely on-chain into sigchains run by [[threshlets]]
