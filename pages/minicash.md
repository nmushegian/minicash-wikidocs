- Welcome to the minicash wiki.
- Minicash is a cryptocurrency with a tiny and final spec.
	- A *tiny* spec means that it is realistic to see many different cross-tested client implementations, ensuring that it is defined by spec and not reference implementation
	- A *final* spec means that you can reason through the incentives and architecture and make long-term plans knowing that the definition of the system will not be changed by someone else.

- Once the software matures, minicash should be able to handle a peak of about 2300 tps
