- Welcome to the minicash wiki.
- Minicash is a cryptocurrency with a tiny and final spec.
	- A *tiny* spec means that it is realistic to see many different cross-tested client implementations, ensuring that it is defined by spec and not reference implementation.
	- A *final* spec means that you can reason through the incentives and architecture and make long-term plans, knowing that the definition of the system will not be changed by someone else.
-
- Minicash is just a massively simplified version of Bitcoin.
- One goal is to demonstrate how Bitcoin was designed to scale to high throughput with just medium-sized blocks. We say "medium-sized" to emphasize that small vs big block debate both end in unworkable extremes, but a reasonable choice of constants
