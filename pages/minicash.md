- Welcome to the minicash wiki.
- Minicash is a cryptocurrency with a tiny and final spec.
	- A *tiny* spec means that it is realistic to see many different cross-tested client implementations, ensuring that it is defined by spec and not reference implementation.
	- A *final* spec means that you can reason through the incentives and architecture and make long-term plans, knowing that the definition of the system will not be changed by someone else.

- Minicash is just a massively simplified version of Bitcoin.
- One goal is to demonstrate how Bitcoin was designed to scale to high throughput with just medium-sized blocks. We say "medium-sized" to emphasize that small vs big block debate both end in unworkable extremes, but a reasonable choice of constants and finalized protocol sidesteps this debate and allows us to strike a balance between full node requirements and network throughput.
- The reason bitcoin has not scaled even with projects going for the "middle ground" approach (ie, Bitcoin Cash) is that the client is just badly engineered. The client may have started one way or another, but over a decade of patchwork engineering ha
