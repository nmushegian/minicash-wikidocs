- The `time` field of a [[tock]] is defined to be 57 seconds larger than the previous tock.
- It is important to understand what tocktime is and is not.
- Tock time is *not* the exact time that a tock was created.
- Pools can create tocks with a particular timestamp any time they want.
- The best pool strategy is to treat the tock time as an *interval*, during which pools can switch from mining the previous tock to accepting and mining one of the new tocks.
- Pools might choose to delay publishing their tock for as long as possible within the interval, to make it have higher work.
- In this situation, they are forgoing the chance to work on an earlier tock, if it has higher work.
- In any case, the optimal strategy is to switch to the best valid tock *when you receive it*, and to send your best valid tock *so that nodes process it as soon as possible*.
- The reality of networks might make it so that *some delay is beneficial* to spend extra time working on a tock during the time that nodes are processing eagerly send tocks.
- Recall that short reorgs are not considered problematic at all. They are part of the consensus process. Pool nodes can adjust and tune their strategies based on their connectivity.
-
- Tock time is only an *approximate* measure of time *a posteriori*. If you tried to look at real-world chronology in terms of tock time, it would appear to be stretching and shrinking locally, but linear and 1:1 with real time globally.
