- The design of the database layer of minicash is perhaps the most important part of creating a performant minicash client.
- Minicash acknowledges the reality of forking head-on and relaxes the POW rules to make them simpler to specify but leading to continuous forking instead of treating it like an exception.
-
- Minicash has two different abstractions for dealing with the tree of blocks and system state.
- The first is called Rock.
	- Rock is a direct key-value store.
	- Rock is insert-only, no value can be changed once inserted. All state is implemented with constant-time access of some small number of values (e.g., "exists" and "spent" status for utxo).
	- A database transaction over a rock is called a `rite`. We say "database transaction" to emphasize that this is not minicash transaction, which is called a `tick`. Processing a tick happens at a different layer of abstraction.
- The second is called Tree.
	- Tree is a key-value store with an immutable map API. You could call this a "pure map" or an "immutable map", although in a precise definition you should try to avoid these terms and emphasize that it is an *API* that navigates an abstraction in the underlying rock.
	- A database transaction over a tree is called a `twig`.
