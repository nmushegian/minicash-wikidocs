- At a high level,
	- `dmon` receives mail from `plug`, and ensures messages are well-formed rolls
	- `dmon` gives messages to `djin`, which does 3 main things,
		- well-formed checks (`well`) for any data it works with
		- valid-in-context checks (`vinx`) to check all validation conditions except for double spend critical path and tock fees
			- [[checksig]]
		- critical path and state transition (`vult`) to check the net tock [[fees]] as well as unique-live-spend condition, meaning a UTXO must exist and not be spent
			- hash-addressed data is added to `rock`
			- system state is added to `tree` which is a pure map giving a per-snapshot view of the system state
		- `djin` keeps track of best known valid state
	- `dmon` requests best known headers from peers and calls them possibly-valid
		- as it validates full tocks, it grows a tree of definitely-valid chains
	- `dmon` responds to requests using the best definitely-valid state
-
- The key point is that all steps prior to `vult` can be done without writing to the database at all, and `vult` manipulates a pure db abstraction over append-only data model which needs only real-time write locks which update one contested internal map value and in theory could even be implemented with a lock-free algorithm. The engine can thus process critical paths for multiple candidate chains at once, and in practice will likely be able to deal with real time branch switching between candidates on just one critical path thread for all branches.
