- At a high level,
	- `dmon` receives mail from `plug`, and ensures messages are well-formed rolls
	- `dmon` gives messages to `djin`, which does 3 main things,
		- well-formed checks (`well`) for any data it works with
		- valid-in-context checks (`vinx`) to check all validation conditions except for double spend critical path
			- signature check
		- critical path and state transition (`vult`) to check the unique-live-spend condition, meaning a UTXO must exist, not be spent, and not be expired ([[burn]] time)
			- hash-addressed data is added to `rock`
			- system state is added to `tree` which is a pure map giving a per-snapshot view of the system state.
