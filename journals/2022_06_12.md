- I type a bit about programming language [[vlang]]
- I think this is probably a very underrated language
- There are 100 C/C++ replacement language attempts and I think this one is the one thay nails it
- V appears both “done” and “complete” at the language level, it is not going to add more keywords or core types or anything like that, but it actually has all the things you need including memory management options and concurrency primitives

- Install was easy like git clone and make.
	- Not a hazing experience like trying to install zig
	- Compiling examples also works first try
- compiled js output is somewhat readable, much more readable than average C/js output (except ts obviously)
- this guy has good aesthetics in his stdlib, good short names
